Graph visualization for complex continuous integration pipelines

cigraph.js provides a 'bird's eye view' of a continuous integration (CI) pipeline.  In complex build environments, developers are unaware of how the build environment is setup and what to look for when CI fails at any stage.  It is not the developer's job to understand thoroughly how CI operates, but they should know immediately when and where it fails.  That way, developers understand when and where CI failed and can move quickly to fix the problem (the crux of continuous integration).
